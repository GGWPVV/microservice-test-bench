# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
## Project: Microservice Discount System
_Version: 1.0 | Last updated: 2025-07-29 | Author: Development Team_

---

## 1. Overview

This document specifies the functional and non-functional requirements for a microservice-based discount calculation system. The system encompasses user management, score generation, discount calculation, and analytics logging across four independent microservices.

**Scope**: Core functionality with future extensibility. API-only system without user interface.

---

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Architecture
The system consists of four microservices:
- **user_service**: User registration and authentication
- **score_service**: Score generation and leaderboard management  
- **discount_service**: Discount calculation based on user criteria
- **analytics_service**: Event logging and data aggregation

### 2.2 Service Communication
- **Synchronous**: REST APIs for real-time operations
- **Asynchronous**: Kafka events for decoupled communication
- **Caching**: Redis for performance optimization
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL (users, scores), MongoDB (analytics)

**Output Data**: Username, discount percentage (0.0-0.2)

**Business Rules**:
- BR-018: Age â‰¥ 40 years grants 10% discount
- BR-019: Top 10 leaderboard position grants 10% discount  
- BR-020: Discounts are cumulative (maximum 20%)
- BR-021: Results cached in Redis for 1 hour

- HTTP 401: `{"detail": "Invalid token"}`
- HTTP 400: `{"detail": "Invalid user data"}`
- HTTP 500: Internal server error

### 3.4 Analytics Service (REQ-004)

- `discount.calculated`

**Business Rules**:
- BR-023: All events must be persisted to MongoDB
